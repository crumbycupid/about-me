      Onward
    </h2>
    <p>
      My Goals. I am currently and proudly serving my country, and until that time ends, I will be the best ditch digging savage that money can buy. I have a passion for Architecture. I feel my journey has led me to the Technological side of said persuit, though I would still like to renew my education in Industrial Architecture. To be mentioned in the same breath as architects such as Zaha Hadid, Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and artist such as Basquiat and Romero Britto. So, I want to be the best in the world. I would like to win a Pulitzer Prize. I don't know what the award is for, but it sounds cool, and I want it. I have a desire to follow in the footsteps of my late Grandfather, Everett Steawart, and be a great community leader and humanitarian.
